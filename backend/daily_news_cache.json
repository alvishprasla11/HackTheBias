The Iranian state media frames these events as a coordinated 'sedition' instigated by the US and Israel, justifying a harsh security response. Conversely, Western governments and media outlets portray the unrest as a legitimate, popular demand for human rights and democratic change, with the US administration explicitly calling for a change in Iranian leadership. Independent reporting confirms the scale of the violence but expresses deep concern over the potential for escalation, noting that many Iranians are wary of both the regime and the motives of foreign powers. The core conflict remains a struggle over the legitimacy of the ruling structure, viewed internationally through the lens of geopolitical rivalry.",
        "information_quality": "The information landscape is highly polarized. The Iranian government's narrative is unreliable due to state control and censorship. The Western narrative is colored by a strong ideological desire for regime change. The most reliable, albeit fragmented, information is likely coming from independent citizen journalists on social media, though this content requires rigorous verification due to the chaotic environment and potential for disinformation from all sides."
