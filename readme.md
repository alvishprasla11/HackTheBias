# HackTheBias - Your Unbiased News Platform

## Overview

HackTheBias is an all-in-one news platform designed to deliver objective, unbiased news coverage by aggregating multiple perspectives on the same story.

- **Confirmation bias** - People seek information that confirms existing beliefs
- **Filter bubbles** - Algorithms show content aligned with user preferences
- **Media polarization** - News outlets cater to specific political audiences
- **Incomplete stories** - Single-source reporting misses important context
